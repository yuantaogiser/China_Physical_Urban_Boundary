# China_Physical_Urban_Boundary

**Details for accuracy assessment: **
  The FID in the shapefile includes "layer", "CPUB", "GUB", and "STEP1".

  "layer" means the label of these points (0: Non-urban; 1: Urban).
  "CPUB", "GUB", and "STEP1" include four numbers (1,2,3,4), meaning the confusion matrix. 
  (1: TP; 2: FN; 3: FP; 4:TN)
